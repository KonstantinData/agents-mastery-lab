    "You will practice applying reflection patterns to strengthen agent reasoning and outputs.\n",

    "To do this, you will build **evaluation loops** where the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reviews its own intermediate results (such as draft SQL or tool outputs).\n",
    "* Identifies errors or gaps.\n",
    "* Checks its responses and tool use.\n",
