    "### 1.1. Lab overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this ungraded lab, you will practice applying **reflection patterns** to enhance how agents reason and generate visualizations. You will analyze how an agent can detect issues in its own chart outputs‚Äîsuch as unclear labels, misleading scales, or poor aesthetics‚Äîand refine its plotting code before finalizing an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ 1.2. Learning outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply reflection patterns to improve agent reasoning and chart outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you will implement evaluation loops where an agent reviews its own (or external) generated charts, identifies potential errors or gaps, and revises its plotting code before producing the final visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generate an Initial Version (V1):**\n",
    "Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to create the first version of the plotting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execute and Render:** \n",
    "Run the generated code and display the resulting chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reflect on the Output:**\n",
    "Evaluate both the code and the chart using an LLM to detect areas for improvement (e.g., clarity, accuracy, design).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate and Execute Improved Version (V2):**\n",
    "Produce a refined version of the plotting code based on reflection insights and render the enhanced chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this reflective workflow, you will experience how agents can progressively improve visualization quality by combining code generation with intelligent feedback."

    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs update our workflow to try a new example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Previous instruction:** ‚ÄúGive me a breakdown of drink sales by quarter.‚Äù\n",
    "- **New instruction:** \"Create a chart showing year-over-year Q1 sales by drink type.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôre encouraged to experiment with your own chart prompts!\n",
    "When you change the instructions, remember to also update the `image_basename` parameter. This helps keep your saved chart files organized and ensures their filenames reflect the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "By customizing both the instructions and filenames, you can adapt the workflow to many different analyses while keeping your results neat and easy to track.\n",

    "### Available models for generation and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your workflow lets you choose which models handle chart generation and which handle evaluation. Here are the options:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generation models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gpt-3.5-turbo** ‚Äì Reliable and versatile for many tasks.\n",
    "- **gpt-4.1-mini** ‚Äì A lighter version of GPT-4.1, optimized for speed.\n",
    "- **gpt-4.1** ‚Äì Full-featured GPT-4.1 with strong reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "- **gpt-4o-mini** ‚Äì Compact and fast, good for quicker experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **o4-mini** ‚Äì Lightweight and efficient for evaluation.\n",
    "- **claude-3-5-haiku-20241022** ‚Äì Specialized for concise, precise feedback.\n",
    "- **claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219** ‚Äì Advanced evaluation model with deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, any of the generation models can also be used for evaluation. This flexibility lets you try different combinations and see how they impact the quality of your charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with these models to find different scenarios!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note on LLM responses:** LLM outputs are stochastic ‚Äî meaning that even with the same input and parameters, results can vary each time you run the workflow. This randomness is a feature, not a bug: it allows you to explore multiple possible solutions. For more reliable insights, try running your workflow several times and comparing results."
